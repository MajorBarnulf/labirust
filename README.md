# Labirust

Labyrinths, in Rust.

## Description

Naive rust crate for implementing and testing maze solving Algorithms.

## Context

Hi, I am a junior rust dev (yes, how original, I know) and this is one of the small projects I do to learn the language and feel its system or learn its good practices.

## Usage

If you want to see what the library is capable of, you can clone this repo and run the tests to see mazes solving themselves on the terminal.

for you to see anything during the execution of tests, don't forget to add these arguments:
```sh
-- --nocapture

# example:
cargo test -- implementations::breath_first --nocapture
```

If you want to implement more resolution algorithm yourself and for some reason you think this is the right crate to provide frameworks, you can explore the crate documentation and add this crate to your project dependencies.
